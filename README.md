##Python for Data Project Summary
The opioid epidemic has affected central Appalachia much more so than other regions of the country. For my project, I wanted to create a visualization that represented the extent to which the Appalachian states were affected relative to other areas of the country. I used data supplied from the CDC on the number of overdose deaths state by state to produce my visualization. I had originally intended to create an interactive heat map of the country but, due to time constraints and school responsibilities, I settled for a plain ole' bar graph. At the bottom of my python script is a large block of commented out code that is intended to produce this map. Come back in May and you'll find a stunning map.

#Running the Project
1. If you don't already have python and pip installed on your machine make sure you get those installed.
2. Clone the repo and cd into \overdose_death_percentages_project
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `python proj.py` 

Setting up the database takes a few moments but everything should run smoothly and Bokeh will open up a browser with my chart there for you to see.

Thanks and I hope to see you all next session! :D
